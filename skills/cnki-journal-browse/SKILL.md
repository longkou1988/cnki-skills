# CNKI journal-browse

1. Use the visible 出版物检索/期刊导航 control from the CNKI entry or a supplied journal link. Search the exact journal name.
2. Verify identity by journal title, ISSN/CN number and publisher if displayed; do not convert the name to a guessed URL slug.
3. Read journal scope and accessible metadata, then open the offered year/issue controls and extract its article list.
4. If the user requests latest articles, distinguish online-first material from the most recent numbered issue.
5. Report any journal metrics with the source edition/year. Do not equate CNKI composite impact factor with JCR impact factor or infer a current core-journal classification.
6. Extract article links from the issue itself; preserve sequence and mark shortened authors. Pagination follows visible controls.
7. External editorial/publisher links are a separate destination; label them and preserve the user's access route.

## Browser and access
Use the user's available browser connector. Claude Code: Chrome DevTools MCP
(list pages → select page → take snapshot → interact). Codex: use its available
browser skill/tool and documented API. WorkBuddy: the `browser-skill` CLI (`bsk`)
— `bsk session start` → `bsk navigate <url> --session <id>` → `bsk snapshot` →
interact → `bsk session stop <id>` (mandatory, even on error paths). Read that
tool's instructions first; do not assume Chrome DevTools names exist in the other
runtimes. If no connector is available, report the missing dependency, without
installing it implicitly.

Start at an already-open CNKI official/authorized institutional entry. Otherwise
**default to the domestic CNKI site**, in this order:
1. https://kns.cnki.net/kns8s/defaultresult/index — domestic 检索 entry (verified
   working: renders 主题 + 学术期刊 controls and the result table, and honours an
   institutional login).
2. https://www.cnki.net/ — domestic homepage, only if the entry above is unreachable.

Never start at an overseas mirror (oversea.cnki.net, global.cnki.net,
data.oversea.cnki.net, scholar.cnki.net, ar.oversea.cnki.net or similar).
Detection: if the page title is "CNKI Overseas" or the host contains `oversea`,
you are on the international platform — www.cnki.net may silently redirect there
depending on the network exit point. Navigate straight to the kns.cnki.net entry
above instead of staying on the mirror.
Preserve the current institution route and observed links; do not reconstruct
proxy URLs or trust a hostname solely because it contains "cnki".
Inspect current visible controls before acting; refresh observations after navigation.
Do not invent selectors, search API payloads, article URLs, download hashes or session tokens.
Use read-only DOM extraction only if supported and grounded in observed markup.
If an operation fails twice without progress, preserve completed records and report
the blocker. Login and CAPTCHA require user intervention under the runtime policy;
do not evade detection or bypass access controls. Do not export cookies or credentials.
Close owned temporary tabs when finished, retaining only a page needed for user handoff.

### Overseas fallback (last resort only)
Fall back to an overseas mirror only when the domestic site is genuinely
unreachable or blocked for the user — for example kns.cnki.net times out, returns
a network/ISP block page, or shows an access blocker with no institutional route
available. When that happens:
1. Tell the user explicitly that the domestic site failed, state the observed
   reason (timeout, block page, missing institution entitlement), and say you are
   switching to the international platform.
2. Record which platform produced every result: the overseas edition indexes a
   different corpus, so counts, full text and export formats are not comparable
   with domestic CNKI results.
3. Re-check whether an authorized domestic route exists before continuing; if the
   user has one, ask before settling for the overseas edition.
Do not treat a plain redirect to oversea.cnki.net as "the domestic site is down"
by itself — navigate to the kns.cnki.net entry first.

## Evidence
This release is a UI-guided workflow, not a tested site scraper. In development,
www.cnki.net redirected to oversea.cnki.net; Chinese language selection reached
/chn/, exposing 主题, 搜索, 高级检索 and 出版物检索. Clicking 高级检索 on the
overseas platform triggered a puzzle CAPTCHA before query submission.
A later run opened https://kns.cnki.net/kns8s/defaultresult/index directly: the
domestic 检索 page rendered 主题/学术期刊 controls and a result table, an
institutional login was recognised, and a 主题 keyword search returned 总库 /
学术期刊 / 学位论文 counts without a CAPTCHA. The domestic entry is therefore the
verified default; the overseas platform is fallback only (see above).
Domestic full-text download and export controls remain unverified. Treat domestic
and international platforms separately. Never report an attempted click as a
successful search/export/download. Keep publication date, online-first date and
indexing date distinct. Missing fields stay missing.
